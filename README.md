# beamer_app

This is a project where you can share your location by carrying the beacon, and have other people follow your beacon by sharing an uuid-based passkey. It uses Websockets for realtime tracking and a back-end [flutter-beamer-backend](https://github.com/Piero512/flutter-beamer-backend) to keep up with the location data. It uses flutter_map because it's free to use with OpenStreetMap tiles.
